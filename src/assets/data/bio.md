I'm a tenured professor of law at the University of Iowa (with courtesy appointments in philosophy and political science). My research is focused on the nexus of normative political theory, constitutional law, and social science, with key areas of inquiry including: the rule of law as a normative and scientific concept, classical Athenian law, critical race theory, and, most recently, the intersection of computational methods and law.  

Current projects include investigating the relationship between the rule of law, democratic theory and judicial review; the jurisprudential implications of quantitative prediction of judicial decisions; some investigational applied work on applying data science techniques in the legal context; the relationship between normative and empirical methods in constitutional law; and the transformative potential of legal technology and access to justice. I've also published side-projects or extension-projects relating to corruption; economic equality, markets, and liberty; paternalism; and the Affordable Care Act.  Trust me, these are all connected. I tend to make use of a cluster of methodological tools in my work, including normative and conceptual techniques from philosophy, game theory and statistical methods from political science, and of course doctrinal legal analysis.

You can buy my first book, [The Rule of Law in the Real World](http://rulelaw.net) (Cambridge University Press, 2016).

In the classroom, I usually find myself teaching Constitutional Law (I and II), Torts soon, and in the past and possible future the Policy Lab, Professional Responsibility (legal ethics). Back in grad school, I participated in teaching a number of topical courses in contemporary political theory in various ways. One day, I intend to find an excuse to teach Classical Athenian Law, Jurisprudence, and/or Quantitative and Computational methods for lawyers, and a hybrid political theory/social scientific methods seminar, all of which I've been scheming up for years.

My primary training was at Harvard Law School (J.D.) and Stanford Political Science (Ph.D.). Past affiliations include the Institute for Advanced Study (Member, School of Social Science, 2014-5), the University College Cork Attic Greek summer intensive, and, long, long ago, the Cal State LA [Early Entrance Program](http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/eep). Current affiliations include (loosely) the University of Iowa Informatics Initiative, (less loosely, I'm on the board) the University of Iowa Obermann Center for Advanced Studies, and the Iowa City Telecommunications Commission. Toward the end of summer 2017, I'll be a member of a batch at the Recurse Center, working on some open source stuff in some combination of Clojure, Python, Javascript, R, and whatever new languages I want to learn.
