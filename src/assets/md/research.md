, with key areas of inquiry including: the rule of law as a normative and scientific concept, classical Athenian law, critical race theory, and, most recently, the intersection of computational methods and law

Current projects include investigating the relationship between the rule of law, democratic theory and judicial review; the jurisprudential implications of quantitative prediction of judicial decisions; some investigational applied work on applying data science techniques in the legal context; the relationship between normative and empirical methods in constitutional law; and the transformative potential of legal technology and access to justice. I've also published side-projects or extension-projects relating to corruption; economic equality, markets, and liberty; paternalism; and the Affordable Care Act.  Trust me, these are all connected. I tend to make use of a cluster of methodological tools in my work, including normative and conceptual techniques from philosophy, game theory and statistical methods from political science, and of course doctrinal legal analysis.
