Over the last few years, my research has been focused on understanding the rule of law as an ideal at the nexus of normative political theory, constitutional law, and social science; this has culminated in a book, The Rule of Law in the Real World, courtesy of Cambridge University Press.

I've also published research about critical race theory; about legal technology; about Classical Athenian law and political thought; about corruption; about economic equality, markets, and liberty; about the democratic legitimacy of judicial review; and about the Affordable Care Act. (These topics are actually connected!)

Currently, I'm working on new projects about the rule of law in the United States; about Black American liberation movements and their relationship to constitutional theory; and about platform governance. In the more distant future, I have projects in the hopper about computational approaches to law, particularly the machine-reading of legal text and predicting legal outcomes---and their normative implications.
