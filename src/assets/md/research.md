Over the last few years, my research has been focused on understanding the rule of law as an ideal at the nexus of normative political theory, constitutional law, and social science; this has culminated in a book, The Rule of Law in the Real World, courtesy of Cambridge University Press.

Currently, I'm transitioning into more computational approaches to law, particularly the machine-reading of legal text and predicting legal outcomes---and their normative implications. I'm also immersed in an extended project on democratic theory and judicial review.

I've also published research about critical race theory; about Classical Athenian law and political thought; about corruption; about economic equality, markets, and liberty; and about the Affordable Care Act. (These topics are actually connected!)
