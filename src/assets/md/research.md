Over the last few years, my research has been focused on understanding the rule of law as an ideal at the nexus of normative political theory, constitutional law, and social science; this has culminated in two books, *The Rule of Law in the Real World*, courtesy of Cambridge University Press, and *The Rule of Law in the United States: An Unfinished Project of Black Liberation*, courtesy of Hart Publishing.

I've also published research about critical race theory; about legal technology; about Classical Athenian law and political thought; about corruption; about economic equality, markets, and liberty; about the democratic legitimacy of judicial review; and about the Affordable Care Act. (These topics are actually connected!)

Currently, I'm working on continuing projects about about Black American liberation movements and their relationship to constitutional theory; about platform governance; and about criminal justice and the rule of law, as well as the protection of racial, cultural and religious minorities.
