I'm a tenured professor of law at the [University of Iowa](https://law.uiowa.edu/paul-gowder) (with courtesy appointments in [philosophy](https://clas.uiowa.edu/philosophy/people/paul-gowder) and [political science](https://clas.uiowa.edu/polisci/people/paul-gowder)). My research is focused on the nexus of normative political theory, constitutional law, and social science. (You can see more in the research section of this website.)

At Iowa, I've taught Constitutional Law (I and II), Torts and Policy Lab, and Professional Responsibility (legal ethics). Back in grad school, I taught or TAed a number of topical courses in contemporary political theory. Possible future teaching I've been scheming up include Classical Athenian Law, Jurisprudence, and/or Quantitative and Computational methods for lawyers, and a hybrid political theory/social scientific methods seminar.

My primary training was at [Harvard Law School](http://hls.harvard.edu/) (J.D., 2000) and [Stanford Political Science](https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/) (Ph.D., 2012).  You can buy my first book, [The Rule of Law in the Real World](http://rulelaw.net) (Cambridge University Press, 2016).
