I'm a tenured professor of law at  [Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law](http://www.law.northwestern.edu/). From 2012-2020 I was at the [University of Iowa](https://law.uiowa.edu/paul-gowder) College of Law (with courtesy appointments in [philosophy](https://clas.uiowa.edu/philosophy/people/paul-gowder) and [political science](https://clas.uiowa.edu/polisci/people/paul-gowder)).  My research is focused on the nexus of normative political theory, constitutional law, and social science, as well as law and technology. (You can see more in the research section of this website.)

As a law professor, I've taught beginning and advanced Constitutional Law courses, Torts, Introduction to Quantitative and Computational Legal Reasoning (a coding and statistics course for lawyers), Critical Race Theory, Policy Lab, and Professional Responsibility (legal ethics). Back in grad school, I taught or TAed a number of topical courses in contemporary political theory. Possible future teaching I've been scheming up include Classical Athenian Law and  Jurisprudence.

My primary training was at [Harvard Law School](http://hls.harvard.edu/) (J.D., 2000) and [Stanford Political Science](https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/) (Ph.D., 2012).  You can buy my first book, [The Rule of Law in the Real World](https://rulelaw.net) (Cambridge University Press, 2016). You can also buy---or download a free open access PDF!---of my second book, [The Rule of Law in the United States: An Unfinished Project of Black Liberation](https://rulelaw.us) (Hart/Bloomsbury, 2021).
