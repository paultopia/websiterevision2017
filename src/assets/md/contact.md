I'm best reached over e-mail. 

If you'd like to reach me on *official University of Iowa business*, please e-mail me at paul-gowder (AT-SYMBOL-GOES-HERE) uiowa.edu.

However, you should be aware that the official e-mail address is subject to the University of Iowa's open records laws. If you'd like to reach me on *personal business*, and *especially* if anything political is involved, please e-mail me at paul.gowder (AT SYMBOL, YEP) gmail.com.

I really prefer not to receive unsolicited telephone calls, and I very rarely check voicemail unless a call has been prearranged.

I'm available to provide comments to the press on constitutional law, ethics in public life, democracy and the rule of law, and legal technology. I'm available for consulting on difficult legal matters for lawyers only (I don't offer legal services to the public). I'm also available for interesting and exciting tech projects.
