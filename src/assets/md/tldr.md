Hello!  I'm Paul Gowder. 

Inside this website, you will find: 

- *Academic stuff* I'm a tenured professor at the University of Iowa, where I teach constitutional law and torts and work in political/legal philosophy, law and technology, and a bit of game theory.  Here, you'll be able to find things like my academic c.v., citations for (and, where possible, downloads of) my publications, commentary and other writings, and good stuff like that.  You may also want to go to the external website for my book, [The Rule of Law in the Real World](http://rulelaw.net) (Cambridge University Press, 2016).

- *Tech stuff* I also write a lot of code, about evenly divided between data science type things (especially text-mining) and small-workflow-tool type things. You'll find some more information about my various tech projects in here, but you might also want to see [my github](https://github.com/paultopia/) or [my experimental tech blog](https://paultopia.github.io/).

- **Cat pictures** randomly scattered throughout, because I have the most beautiful cat.  His name is Leonidas. If I know you personally, ask me for the Instagram link or his Facebook page. 

Major affiliations, credentials, experiences, and other sorts of things you might want to know about if you've googled me to see if I'm someone whose word you should take seriously about something I've said: J.D. Harvard Law; Ph.D. Stanford Political Science; legal practice experience in nonprofit legal aid/poverty law and barely-profitable private civil rights litigation; Institute for Advanced Study member 2014-5; Recurse Center Summer 2 2017 batch.
