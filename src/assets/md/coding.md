Lately I've being doing a lot of programming, both in the course of academic work and for personal projects.  I mostly write in Clojure, Python and JavaScript, though I've also experimented with a few strongly typed languages and not fallen in love with any of them.

Some interesting things I've written include:

This website is written in JavaScript SPA style, using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Which is total overkill (I even broke out a flux-style state management library!), but it was a good excuse to learn that modern JS stuff.  See the code [here](https://github.com/paultopia/paulgowdercom).

From July-August 2017, I'll be a member of the Summer 2 batch at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)
