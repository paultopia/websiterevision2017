Hello!  I'm Paul Gowder. I do law, tech, and ethics.

I'm a tenured professor at the University of Iowa, where I teach constitutional law and torts and work in political/legal philosophy, law and technology, and a bit of game theory.  

Not long ago, I published a book, [The Rule of Law in the Real World](http://rulelaw.net) (Cambridge University Press, 2016).

I also write a lot of code, about evenly divided between data science type things (especially text-mining) and small-workflow-tool type things. 

J.D. Harvard Law; Ph.D. Stanford Political Science; legal practice experience in nonprofit legal aid/poverty law and barely-profitable private civil rights litigation; Institute for Advanced Study member 2014-5; Recurse Center Summer 2 2017 batch.
