Because this is a personal webpage, I have to include a picture of my beautiful cat.  His name is Leonidas. He got the name for three reasons.  First, it starts with "Leo," and he looks like a baby lion. Second, when we adopted him, he was afraid of everything, and he needed the inspiration. Third, he showed an early disposition to blockade doors, and I'm pretty sure that if we'd also adopted a Persian, that cat would never have been allowed to pass.
