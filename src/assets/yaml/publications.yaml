    This short essay sketches the outline of a case for First Amendment protection of private university race-based affirmative action. Unlike other views, it does not depend on either the religious identities of certain universities, or the notion that universities are ideologically committed to any particular view about race and social justice as reflected in the composition of their communities. Instead, it rests on the basic First Amendment freedom of a university to conduct the expressive activities of research and teaching, combined with two observations. First is that far-right activists have for decades attempted to influence the content of university teaching and research by influencing the composition of their faculty and student bodies; this triggers a First Amendment right in universities to resist the efforts of such activists to leverage antidiscrimination law to recruit the state to help them censor university speech. Second is that a university may adopt the theory of standpoint epistemology associated with feminist philosophy of science and critical race theory to connect its capacity to offer teaching and research on the concerns of subordinated groups with its capacity to employ and admit a critical mass of people from those groups.

    The Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, overturning the half-century old constitutional right to reproductive choice, is only the most prominent example of a global series of attacks on rights of personal, sexual, and family autonomy. The attacks on LGBTQ+ rights by the Christian nationalist governments of Hungary and Poland are another important example. A cadre of anti-liberal scholars and public intellectuals such as Patrick Deneen, Sohrab Ahmari, and Adrian Vermeule serve as the intelligentsia within this global reactionary movement, advocating for the direct importation of far-right values into the law of western states on the basis of a religious, anti-liberal conception of community and public identity. In common parlance, the victims of this attack on egalitarian legal rights sometimes say that they are excluded or erased or treated as sub-human. That response is intuitively plausible--it is easy to think, for example, that taking away gay rights excludes LGBTQ+ individuals from the political community by communicating that they lack the support of their societies for their personal relationships and individual identities. But this idea is somewhat undertheorized in the scholarly literature. This Essay contributes to the theoretical development of the idea of rights-retrenchment as exclusion. Reading together Patricia Williams and G.W.F. Hegel, it offers an account of how liberal legal rights support the individual and social identities of those who enjoy them, and how those rights are particularly critical to members of socially subordinated groups. It is concluded that one reason to value the rule of law, in its facet as a demand for the stable protection of individual rights, is to protect this identity-supporting function. This Essay is thus both a critique of the modern anti-liberal movement and an updating of the critical race theory defense of rights for the present era of reaction and retrenchment.

    This chapter elucidates dignity as a rule of law value through an examination of its opposite, humiliation. Focusing as a case study on the author's own unlawful and racially based arrest in 2003 in New Orleans, it unpacks the phenomenon of the abuse of legally conferred power to claim a higherarchically superior status over the victims of that power. It further examines forced self-abnegation as a signal of the failure of the rule of law through the phenomenon of 'the Talk' that parents of color are forced to inflict on their children, counselling them to behave in a subordinate manner toward police.

    This essay argues for an end to law's infamously Byzantine and bloated citation manual, the Bluebook. The very features that make the Bluebook distinctive when compared to citation systems in other academic fields are also those that inflict vast amounts of unnecessary if not downright harmful labor on its users. The root of the problem is its obsolescence: the Bluebook was designed for a system in which legal scholarship was primarily consumed in print and for material where the doctrinal epistemology of authority predominated. Today, legal scholarship is primarily consumed electronically, and it largely shares an epistemology of credence with other scholarly disciplines. (Nor are its hundreds of pages of rules particularly useful for practicing lawyers and judges, who sensibly disregard most of it anyway.) At a minimum, the signals, typographical rules, abbreviations, and cross-references need to be put out of their misery; when those are gone what is left would be practically indistinguishable from the sensible citation systems of other fields, as it should be. Also, we should automate as much as possible---and that turns out to be quite a lot. (Note: the local version of the paper should contain embedded citation information, whereas the official version may not.)

    This paper uses Gerald Postema's _Law's Rule_ to take up one of the most 
    controversial questions in rule of law scholarship: whether the ideal can 
    provide the basis for criticizing the state alone, or private individuals 
    and entities exercising power over others as well. An account of the 
    characteristics of states in virtue of which the rule of law licenses 
    control over their power is developed, followed by an examination of some 
    cases in which non-state holders of power over others might take on some of 
    those characteristics. Under such circumstances, there are rule of law 
    reasons to demand state control of private power.

    We all--users, businesses, governments, and the general public--expect internet platform companies, like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon to govern their users. Without platform governance, we all experience disasters like foreign election interference, vaccine misinformation, counterfeiting, and even genocide. The failures of platform companies result not from mailce, but from companies' inability to manage the complexity of their userbases and products and of their own incentives under the eyes of conflicting internal and external constituencies. Political scientists, constitutional theorists, and other scholars of governance have been studying the efforts of states to govern under complexity for centuries under theoretical rubrics like the problem of knowledge and incentive-compatible institutional design. The Networked Leviathan argues that this hard-won knowledge about states also applies to platforms. The insights from the research in political science and allied disciplines leads inexorably to the conclusion that governments and companies should collaborate to build democratic institutions for platform governance. By permitting ordinary people from across the world to participate in the governance enterprise, we allow those with the knowledge critical to making and applying platform rules to deploy that knowledge where it can make an impact. Democratic governance also allows companies to recruit third parties to help manage their own capacity to make and stick to decisions. The Networked Leviathan offers a case and a roadmap for democratizing the platforms.

    This essay, delivered as the 2023 Enlund Scholar-in-Residence Lecture at DePaul University College of Law and thereafter published in the DePaul Journal for Social Justice, briefly summarizes a Black Liberation approach to constitutional law which begins from the twin propositions that (a) a democratically legitimate constitution must represent the agency of the entire demos, and (b) Black Americans have in fact exercised authorial agency over the U.S. Constitution, but that agency has been consistently disregarded in Supreme Court doctrine.

    A legal theorist reading contemporary criminal justice scholarship is confronted with a troubling sense of dissonance. Foundational to modern accounts of the concept of law are rules, and the chief modality of law\’s operation in ordinary peoples’ lives is said to be in enforcing those (primary) rules. Normative theories by philosophers of law typically deploy this rule-oriented character as a key virtue of legal systems, whether in Fullerian theories of the moral value of law itself in terms of its facilitation of autonomous self-application by individuals of the rules that apply to them, or in theories of the rule of law according to which one of the key criteria of good legal systems is that they only coerce individuals pursuant to rules.

    Yet, criminal justice scholars have known for decades that rule- enforcement is at best incidental to vast swathes of criminal justice. Even before the advent of \"broken windows\" policing, a large portion of police work was focused on coercively organizing public space, with minimal regard to the rules of substantive law. Scholars of misdemeanor adjudication--the judicial destination of the arrests that result from this mode of policing--have described a process in which the ultimate disposition of defendants is unconnected to any serious effort to determine whether some law has been violated. This lawlessness of criminal justice is exacerbated by, and itself exacerbates, America’s underlying system of race and class hierarchy. In short, instead of a system of law enforcement, American criminal justice is a key exemplar of what critical race scholars have called \"structural racism,\" in which individual and organizational incentives reproduce racially unjust outcomes even in the absence of individual racial malice.

    Legal philosophers must reconcile their theories with reality by confronting the fact that a sector of American \"law\" with immense practical significance does not, in fact, constitute an application of law (for conceptual theorists) or the rule of law (for normative theorists) at all.

    In this context, some lessons may be drawn from an analogous juridical context. A handful of scholars have suggested that the system of criminal justice is more administrative than legal. Moreover, advocates and scholars have long articulated severe critiques of the federal administrative state on rule of law grounds. Thus, the discourse around the administrative state can serve as a model for how legal theorists should confront the criminal justice state.

    While some scholars appear to have supposed that the notion of legality simply does not apply to the administrative state, others have propounded radical challenges to that state which have reflected a willingness to sacrifice other important interests in the pursuit of legal fidelity. Results such as the recent Supreme Court decision in West Virginia v. E.P.A. have suggested that even the pursuit of existential policy goals like combatting climate change must give way to the concept of legality underneath challenges to the administrative state. If such challenges are any model to follow, then rule of law advocates and scholars must at least consider similar radical challenges to the criminal justice system, such as police abolition, to be on the table.

    Put differently, everything that critics of U.S. administrative law such as Justice Neil Gorsuch say is wrong with the administrative state is also wrong with the carceral state, but more so. In addition to falling further short of rule of law standards, the lion\'s share of U.S. criminal law as actually practiced on the ground is also targeted against the most vulnerable, violent, and racist to boot. The basic virtue of consistency requires those critics to endorse a root-and- branch reconstitution of American criminal justice.

    This Essay argues that religious exemptions to generally applicable law (or overly generous \"most favored nation\" interpretations of the concept of religious discrimination--which amount in practice to exemptions), also known as \"accommodations,\" should not be extended to members of faith groups with sufficient political, economic, or social power to defend themselves in the democratic process (\"majority religions\"). 

    The argument begins with the best defense of accommodations. From the standpoint of the normative principle known as the rule of law, religious accommodations protect adherents of minority faiths from having their interests disregarded by dominant social and political groups. In the absence of accommodations, religious minorities may be subject to law that does not genuinely treat them as free and equal members of a pluralistic community. However, such considerations cannot justify accommodations for powerful faith groups which are capable of protecting themselves outside the legal system and whose members are unlikely to have their interests disregarded by legislators. Moreover, members of groups with substantial political, social, and economic power can use exemptions not to protect their own freedom and equal standing, but to undermine the freedom and equal standing of others, a dynamic prominently illustrated by litigation over contraception coverage requirements under the Affordable Care Act. 

    Unfortunately, the courts are unlikely to be willing to bear the epistemic burden of sorting exemptions claims by the power of those making them. In view of the likely impending fall of the Employment Division v. Smith doctrine, under which exemptions are not required under the Free Exercise Clause, the argument of this Essay suggests a substantial risk that Free Exercise jurisprudence may actually undermine rather than protect the freedom of those who are not adherents of powerful religions--particularly secularists and adherents of very small and unconventional religions such as Wicca, the Satanic Temple, and others--to pursue their conceptions of the good and the fulfillment of their moral values in their own lives. The most likely future for Free Exercise doctrine threatens to make those of us who are not members of sizable mainstream Abrahamic religions less free and less equal.

    What is the American rule of law? Is it a paradigm case of the strong constitutionalism concept of the rule of law or has it fallen short of its rule of law ambitions? This book traces the promise and paradox of the American rule of law in three interwoven ways. (1) It focuses on explicating the ideals of the American rule of law by asking: how do we interpret its history and the goals of its constitutional framers to see the rule of law ambitions its foundational institutions express? (2) It considers those constitutional institutions as inextricable from the problem of race in the United States and the tensions between the rule of law as a protector of property rights and the rule of law as a restrictor on arbitrary power and a guarantor of legal equality. In that context, it explores the distinctive role of Black liberation movements in developing the American rule of law. (3) Finally, it considers the extent to which the American rule of law is compromised at its frontiers, and the extent that those compromises undermine legal protections Americans enjoy in the interior. It asks how America reflects the legal contradictions of capitalism and empire outside its borders, and the impact of those contradictions on its external goals.

    According to many constitutional lawyers and political scientists, the presidential administration of Donald Trump 
    (for scholars on the left), or the response to that presidency (for scholars on the right) poses serious dangers to American 
    constitutional democracy and the rule of law. However, this Essay argues that a more careful understanding of the contemporary 
    dangers to the American rule of law are both broader-based and longer-term: inequality among the public, and epistemic 
    polarization among the public as well as among legal elites (including constitutional law professors themselves), undermine 
    the capacity of the American people to use the political tools available in our constitutional system to resist any power-grabbing 
    executive, regardless of ideology. The rule of law conflicts of the Trump administration, while dangerous in their own right, are 
    fundamentally symptoms of this broader political and legal crisis.

    Could we insert machine learning into the adjudicative process? This chapter considers the extent of the 
    isomorphism between common-law reasoning from prior cases and machine learning reasoning from prior 
    observations, as well as the normative considerations governing any such use. It ultimately concludes 
    that we could use machine learning models to assist judges in reasoning about some questions of law, but 
    only in the context of an ordinary legal process regulating both the use and the forms of such models. 
    Ultimately, machine learning would be less likely to replace judicial reasoning and legal argument than 
    to move it around.

    This Article draws on Black American intellectual history to offer an approach to fundamental questions of constitutional theory from the standpoint of the politically excluded.
    Democratic constitutional theory is vexed by a series of well-known challenges rooted in the inability to justify law without democracy ("the countermajoritarian difficulty") and the inability to justify any particular composition of the popular demos without law ("the problem of constituent power"). Under conditions of genuine egalitarian political inclusion, a constitutional conception of popular sovereignty derived primarily from the civic republican constitutional patriotism associated with Jürgen Habermas and others can resolve these challenges by providing a conceptual basis for understanding the constitutional demos as a corporate body extending across time and capable of ongoing political legitimation.
    Unfortunately, the constitutional conception cannot justify states, such as the United States, characterized by the persistent exclusion of some legitimate members of the demos from political institutions. The resolution to this problem can be found in an important tradition in Black American constitutional thought, beginning with Frederick Douglass, which represents American constitutional institutions as conditionally worthy of attachment in virtue of their latent normative potential. The correct conception of constitutional legitimacy for the United States combines Douglass’s insights, and those of his intellectual heirs, with those working in the tradition which Habermas represents.

    This article distinguishes two types of legal technology, ‘cheaper lawyers’ (or simply
    replacing the cognitive operations of lawyers in their existing domains with technology)
    and ‘transformative artificial legal cognition’ (or introducing the cognitive operations
    characteristic of lawyers in contexts where human lawyers cannot economically be deployed
    at all). It then makes the case for finding advances in egalitarian access to justice and
    the rule of law primarily in the latter category.

    In this paper, I first defend a broad analogy between our worries about
    individual level paternalism and our worries about antimajoritarian elite
    influences in democratic politics. I then argue that the best objections to
    paternalistic policies in both domains, including those offered by Sunstein
    and Thaler under the label libertarian paternalism, are rooted in democratic
    rather than libertarian ideals. Finally, I offer a preliminary account of
    the conditions under which paternalistic policies are permissible, rooted in
    their compatability with individual and collective agents conceived as
    capable of learning and revising decisions over the course of time.

    We use game theory to argue that perceptions of widespread corruption in the
    judicial processes in many countries create ex ante incentives to act
    corruptly. It is rational (though not moral) to preemptively act corruptly
    when litigating in the courts of such nations. Accordingly, contrary to
    judicial narratives in individual cases-such as the (in)famous
    Chevron-Ecuador dispute used herein as an illustration-the problem of
    corruption in transnational litigation is structural and thus calls for
    structural solutions. The Article offers one such solution: the
    establishment of an international court of civil justice.

    This short essay, published in a law review online supplement, is a response to Stella Elias’s 'Law as a Tool of Terror'. It uses Elias as a jumping-off point to elaborate on the relationship between the rule of law and the notion of terror. It describes a conception of terror as a kind of relational fear rooted in arbitrary power and which amplifies that power and expands its scope. Understood in this way, terror can be seen as a particular danger of inadequately constrained executive law enforcement authority. Elias’s elucidation of the terrorizing function of immigration enforcement can serve as a key case study of the need, when evaluating the scope and dangers of executive power in a constitutional democracy, to look not just at the explicit scope of that power but also at the penumbra created by the capacity of that power to intimidate people away from making use of their formal legal entitlements.

    This short essay, published in a law review online supplement, is a response
    to Corey Brettschneider & David McNamee's 'Sovereign and State: A Democratic
    Theory of Sovereign Immunity.' It also contains a not-published-elsewhere piece of the
    overall theory of the rule of law I have been developing: an argument that
    the rule of law is necessary for democratic legitimacy, for three
    reasons: (1) The conceptual reason: democratic sovereignty relies on
    abstracted (legal) rules to identify the acts that count as those of the
    sovereign demos. (2) The pragmatic reason: effective legal systems are a
    crucial tool of mass coordination, and such tools are required to maintain
    popular authority. (3) The moral reason: the inegalitarian ills of states
    that violate the rule of law are inconsistent with the equal standing of
    citizens presupposed by democratic theory.

    This paper, prepared for a Fordham Law Review symposium on critical race
    theory and empiricism, argues for the consolidation of a methodological
    research program within critical race theory, which draws from insights from
    feminist philosophy of science about the standpoint-dependence and
    system-justification bias of empirical research, as well as from social
    science methodology about the ways in which those biases can be ameliorated
    (or compensated for with counter-bias).

    This paper describes a new model of the relationship between racial
    ascriptions on an individual level, private racial bias, social
    disadvantage, and state action, called the cognitive hierarchical model. As
    the name suggests, it deploys psychological, sociological, and historical
    evidence to argue that racial hierarchy in the wider culture leaks into our
    individual cognitions, and vice versa. Status evaluations turn out to be
    built deep into our racial perceptions. The state, for its part,
    exercises a continuing influence on that culture and the cognitions it
    generates; this gives rise to new grounds for constitutional challenge to
    state complicity in racial hierarchy. To be ascribed a stigmatized racial
    identity is to be subject to continuing harm, which this paper calls
    ascriptive injury. This paper ultimately argues that the state, by
    participating in the continual creation and reinscription of stigmatized
    racial identities, causes such ascriptive injuries, and argues for a
    constitutional remedy. (n.b. The journal seems to ascribe this an
    official publication date of 2014, despite the fact that it did not see
    print until mid-2015; I am not certain what the best choice is to handle
    this, citation-wise.)

    The principle that the law must be general - that it must apply equally to
    all - is often said to be a fundamental demand of legal morality, associated
    with the ideal of the rule of law. But many worry that the formal equality
    of law creates substantive inequalities in a world in which people have
    different capacities, endowments, and fundamental interests. This is a
    theoretical problem at the heart of liberal democracy. The rule of law is
    ordinarily understood to be a basic condition for the legitimacy of
    (small-l) liberal states. Its demands are expressed in provisions of the
    U.S. constitution like the due process and equal protection clauses. And its
    ideals are deeply embedded in the Anglo-American legal tradition, in Magna
    Carta as well as the principles of the common law. If, as some scholars have
    argued, there's something hostile to genuine equality in the rule of law,
    then that hostility is at the heart of our constitutional order. I
    aim to relieve some worries about this putative hostility. The paper carries
    out three tasks. 1) It clarifies what it takes for the state to satisfy the
    rule of law demand that the laws must be general. 2) It shows that the
    evaluation of whether a society comports with the rule of law does not
    depend solely on facts about the legal system, but also on a host of other
    non-legal social facts, particularly, the extent to which some members of
    society are the victims of (non-legal) injustice. And, 3) it shows that the
    rule of law generates a critique of economic injustice. It follows that the
    traditional association of the rule of law with the political right, and its
    critique from the left, are misguided. Ultimately, the paper
    reinterprets the notion of general law as an expressive ideal, meant to
    protect the equal status of the members of a political community. It gives
    an account of the vexed question of how the expressive meaning of a law may
    be found. And it aims to show that rule of law, interpreted in this
    expressive fashion, genuinely protects 'substantive' equality

    In this paper, I defend three claims. First, contra some classicists
    and legal historians, classical Athens during the democratic period
    substantially satisfied the demands of the rule of law (excepting its
    treatment of women, noncitizens, and slaves). I show that arguments to the
    contrary mostly represent an unduly narrow conception of what might count as
    law in Athens, one that inappropriately excludes common-knowledge social
    customs. Second, Athenians saw the rule of law as serving the
    equality of mass and elite, oligarchs and democrats: there was no
    contradiction (again contra some classicists) between the democratic power
    of the masses and the rule of law. This equality consisted in two topoi
    frequently deployed in the Athenian legal and social discourse. First is the
    respect topos, according to which the laws represent respect for the
    democratic polis. To disregard them is to reveal one's lack of respect for
    the polis and one's oligarchic character. Second is the strength topos,
    according to which the laws are the way that the democratic polis exercises
    its power: weak members of the masses cannot stand up to strong members of
    the elite alone, they need the backing of the whole community, and that
    backing is coordinated through the law; to undermine the law is thereby to
    undermine the political power of the masses. Third, this connection
    between equality and the rule of law explains the most striking fact about
    Athenian legality, to wit, the otherwise puzzling effectiveness of the
    amnesty enacted for crimes committed under the Thirty Tyrants. The strength
    topos explains why the democrats in Athens refrained from avenging
    themselves against the Thirty despite their opportunity to do so: by doing
    so, they would have undermined the law, and thereby their own equality. The
    strength topos led the Athenians to take the internal point of view on the
    law.

    This essay offers an argument against the proposition that binding judicial
    review is inconsistent with democracy. The first section considers three
    versions of this countermajoritarian complaint, and concludes that the only
    potentially defensible version is the 'respect complaint,' associated with
    the popular constitutionalists, according to which constitutional courts
    impermissibly override popular legal judgments. The second section offers an
    argument against the respect complaint, centered on the notion that courts
    express rather than override popular legal judgments. The third section
    draws on the second to argue that 'weak judicial review systems,' in which
    legislatures may override constitutional rulings, function the same way as
    'strong judicial review systems,' such as the U.S., in virtue of the fact
    that the courts in each system can wield power over legislatures only to the
    extent they can generally recruit popular support. In light of the empirical
    fact that the extent to which legislatures defer to constitutional courts
    varies widely in weak judicial review systems, I conclude that the question
    of the relationship between judicial review and democracy is really a far
    more fine-grained problem of institutional design, not the simple binary
    choice to have or not have what critics of the U.S. system have misguidedly
    named 'judicial supremacy.'

    This paper gives a novel reading of the argument addressed by the Laws of
    Athens to Socrates in Plato's Crito. Many philosophers have suggested that
    the argument of the Laws is merely a weak 'rhetorical sop' to Crito.
    However, I offer an interpretation of that argument that brings out its
    plausibility, particularly in the context of the post-Oligarchic demos of
    early fourth-century Athens. For on Crito's plan, Socrates would have
    undermined a critical form of civic trust in Athens, not by merely
    disobeying the sentence imposed on him by the jury, but by openly displaying
    the legal impunity of the rich. We can call this 'legal trust.'  By
    that coinage, I mean citizens' faith in their fellow citizens' willingness
    and ability to collectively defend the law---to enforce it against the
    powerful, and refrain from acting to undermine that capacity. When the
    members of a democratic political community recognize one another's
    commitment to their legal system, they are able to defend the laws that hold
    their democracy together; in such a state, the laws are both conceptually
    constitutive of democratic authority and practically necessary for
    democracy. Taken in the context of the strategic structure of the
    Athenian legal system, in the appeal to the filial loyalty Socrates owed the
    Laws we can see just such an account of the interweaving of law, trust, and
    citizenship in the preservation of a democracy. The Laws demand that
    Socrates be trustworthy, and thereby refrain from undermining his fellow
    citizens' trust in them, where that trust is necessary for the citizens'
    collective defense of the democratic legal system; they make this demand on
    Socrates in virtue of the Laws' role in Socrates's identity as citizen.

    In this paper, I describe a category of political values that I call
    institutional values. An institutional value (the quintessential examples of
    which are democracy and the rule of law) is distinct from an ordinary (or
    abstract) political value like justice by having both descriptive and
    evaluative components. I defend a method of sorting out correct from
    incorrect conceptions of an institutional value that relies on two ideas:
    coherence and verisimilitude.

    The literature contains two concepts of corruption which are often confused
    with one another: corruption as twisted character (pollution), and
    corruption as disloyalty. It also contains two sites for corruption: the
    corruption of individuals, and the corruption of entire institutions such as
    a state or a legislature. This paper first draws a clear distinction
    between the pollution and disloyalty concepts of corruption in the
    individual context, and then defends a conception of disloyalty corruption
    according to which the distinguishing feature is an agent who uses powers
    delegated to her from her principal as her own. Then, the paper shifts gears
    to the institutional context, arguing that the best account of institutional
    corruption in the extant literature is of the pollution kind. It then fills
    the remaining logical space by laying out a conception of institutional
    corruption as disloyalty and explaining its moral significance for the
    political legitimacy of a democracy.

    John Tomasi's 'market democrat' is right to suppose that Rawlsians have
    erred in omitting economic liberty from their theories of justice. A
    Rawlsian ought to include economic liberty as a basic freedom because it
    facilitates individuals' development and pursuit of their conceptions of the
    good. However, the most plausible version of economic liberty will require
    the state to guarantee, if possible, that no one will be driven by economic
    desperation to engage in immiserating work, which may impair rather than
    facilitate his or her pursuit of the good. There is reason to worry that
    contemporary economies such as the United States fall seriously short of
    that ideal.

    This paper offers an expressive interpretation of Chief Justice Roberts's
    opinion in NFIB v. Sebelius, focusing on the Chief Justice's distinction
    between a command, which 'restricts' a citizen's 'lawful choice' to do or
    not do some act, and a tax, which allegedly does not work such a
    restriction. I argue that the quoted language can be charitably understood
    as an interpretation of what it means for an act to be unlawful. For the
    state to say that an act is unlawful and impose a penalty on it is to
    express disapproval of that act; no such disapproval is expressed merely by
    taxing an act. NFIB v. Sebelius raises this expressive aspect of outlawing
    to constitutional significance. n.b. A heavily revised version with
    slight changes to the argument was reprinted as 'The Health Insurance
    Mandate Really is a Tax, and That's a Good Thing Too,' also listed in this
    publications list.

    This paper prevents a novel account of the rule of law and its normative
    value. Conventional conceptions of the rule of law are rooted in an idea of
    liberty. The standard account supposes that the rule of law is valuable
    because, e.g., it permits citizens to plan their lives, and thereby supports
    their free choices. This paper, by contrast, defends an egalitarian
    theory of the rule of law. The rule of law fosters vertical equality between
    officials and ordinary citizens by requiring officials to treat citizens
    with respect when they use their public powers, and by forbidding systems of
    state terror. It fosters horizontal equality among ordinary citizens by
    requiring citizens to reciprocally share the cost to produce the public good
    of law and order, and by forbidding the creation of legal castes.
      Reimagining the rule of law as an egalitarian principle supports a
    new account of what the rule of law demands, focused on three principles:
    regularity, publicity, and generality. Together, they require that official
    power be used only under laws that citizens can participate in enforcing,
    and that treat all citizens as equals.

    This paper draws on a case study of the Athenian amnesty after the
    blood-soaked rule of the Thirty Tyrants (404-3 B.C.E.) to draw out some
    ideas about the role of commitment-keeping in transitional justice. There is
    an important value, for the maintenance of the rule of law, to a
    transitional democracy in keeping its post-conflict legal commitments,
    independent of the substantive content of those commitments (e.g., to offer
    amnesty to the prior regime, to prosecute that regime, etc.).  I also
    argue that the Athenian mass jury, because of its size, publicity, and
    representativeness, had an unusual capacity to help democratic citizens
    signal their commitment to the rule of law to their fellows: it allowed them
    to indicate their willingness to sacrifice their personal preferences
    (punishing oligarchs) in the cause of upholding the law, by voting in
    accordance in the jury-room. In transitional conditions, this signaling
    function is critically important in building a record of legal trust to
    strengthen nascent democratic legal systems; the paper closes by suggesting
    that the truth commissions often seen in contemporary transitional states
    can serve some of the same functions.

    The Rule of Law in the Real World gives a comprehensive new theory of the
    political and legal ideal known as the rule of law: what it means (the
    coordinated collective control of power), why it matters (it constitutes a
    morally important kind of social equality), and how these properties should
    be taken into account in social scientific attempts to measure it as well as
    policy efforts to promote it.
