I'm sick of having to double-check all the fields, so, for future reference, here are the fields for each one.

Everything is lowercase in actual files.  I use uppercase in this file only to denote stuff with children.

If an entry with children in this list is denoted with an:

- (a) it is an array.  If it
  - - has children, it's an array of objects where each object has the fields listed below;
  - - does not have children, it's an array of string entries.

- (o) it's an object, with sub-objects or sub-arrays as noted.

- (s) it's a singleton object, with string fields as children.
