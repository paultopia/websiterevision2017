1.  convert YAML in dropbox folder to json in github folder (needs to be built)
2.  update last-updated date (not yet done) (UPDATE: DONE)
3.  compile pdf cv (ready to go) and push to dropbox folder (not yet established)
4.  compile docx cv (needs to be fixed) and push to dropbox folder
5.  npm run build (ready to go)
6.  scp up to servers (not yet done)

Steps to build process: 

Step 1: add dropbox folder, get everything converted to yaml, write json-to-yaml.js and yaml-to-json.js (only the latter will be in big script)
Step 2: get good node date library and write update-last-updated.js (DONE)
Step 3: just hook a copy to dropbox folder in existing script.  ALSO move cv compilation script to buildscripts folder for organizational rationality.
Step 4: rewrite docx template for existing json format, also loop to dropbox folder
Step 6: find out scp info for both servers, make sure keys are up, etc.

Overall: then string all these individual scripts plus npm run build together into one big build script or makefile.
