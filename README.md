> Revision of personal website in 2017, with Vue and all that jazz.

This is just a total overkill revision of my personal/professional website. It's live, and lives at http://gowder.io as well as http://paul-gowder.com (Right now, they're mirrors.  The former is preferred, I'm going to do some hosting moves with the latter sooner or later, and also try to consolidate down the road.)

The progression over the years has been something like: 

2012ish: Wordpress.

2015ish: raw HTML generated by a Python script with very little actual templating, Bootstrap, a CV created by templating a MS Word document and auto-printing it, and a bit of fun stuff with JQuery.

2017: all the ridiculousness of the modern front-end web: a SPA with Vue, prerendering, hand-rolled and moderately buggy navigation, Webpack, ES6, handwritten CSS with responsive-ish layout using media queries and Flexbox (but not Sass or SCSS or whatever the flavor of the month is there), LaTeX and HTML CVs and BibTeX rendered from the same YAML->JSON pipeline with a makefile. YOLO.

2019-20 and now the same but with continuous integration so I build on push, wheeeee
